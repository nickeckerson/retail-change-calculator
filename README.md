This is a simple Python console program that calculates how much change a customer should receive after purchasing an item, including a 6% sales tax.

The user enters:

- Listed price of the item
- Amount the customer paid

The program applies a 6% tax to the price, subtracts the total cost from the amount paid, and prints the change due, formatted to two decimal places.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the `change.py` file.
3. In a terminal, run:

```bash
python change.py
